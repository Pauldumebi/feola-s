`This GUI application was created with the help of the Python Tkinter GUI framework and additional helpful Python packages like pandas and numpy. The requirements.txt file contains a list of requirements.`

`To launch the GUI application: `

`NB: This project supports` **Python 3!** **Python 3!!** **Python 3!!!** 
`To run this project the necessary software, packages and versions needs to be installed `

# Installation

```````````````````````````````````````````````````step 1: `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `

⊛ **Python installation (Python 3)** `- To install python visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download a python interpreter compatible with your device. Check that python3 was installed successfully.` `Nb: For` **Mac** `the inbuilt one should updated to` **Python 3**.

```````````````````````````````````````````````````step 2: `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `

⊛ **Packages and their versions** `- To install the required packages and their corresponding versions, which are listed in the requirements.txt file, open the project folder in `**Command Prompt** `and type the command between the asterisks` ***python -m pip install -r requirements.txt***. `This works differently for` **Mac** `use` ***python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt***. 

```````````````````````````````````````````````````step 3: `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `

⊛ **Start GUI** - `Upon successful installation, Open the project folder in` **Command Prompt** `and type the command between the asterisks` ***python -m app***. `This works differently for` **Mac** `use` ***python3 -m app***, `this should start the GUI application. If you encounter any error kindly refer to the previous steps to ensure you have the correct packages and versions installed.`

# To run unit test

`In this project, the testing-driven development (TDD) methodology was used. The unit tests are included in` **test_tkinter_app.py**. `The steps below below explain how to execute the functional tests used for this project and calculate the application's test coverage.`

```````````````````````````````````````````````````step 1: `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `

⊛ `Open the project folder in` **Command Prompt** `and type the command between the asterisks then hit enter` ***python -m test_tkinter_app***. `This works differently for` **Mac** `use` ***python3 -m test_tkinter_app***, `this runs all the test contained in the project for the GUI application.`

```````````````````````````````````````````````````step 2: `````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````` `

⊛ `To check for test coverage, Open the project folder in` **Command Prompt** 

1. `To run the tests with coverage, type the command between the asterisks then hit enter` ***python -m coverage run -m unittest discover***. `This works differently for` **Mac**  `use` ***python3 -m coverage run -m unittest discover***, `this runs all test and calculates the coverage.`
    
2. `To report the coverage in` **Command Prompt** `type` ***python -m coverage report -m***. `For` **Mac** `use` ***python3 -m coverage report -m***, `this will report the extent of test coverage carried out.`
